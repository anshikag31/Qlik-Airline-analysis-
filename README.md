## PROJECT TITLE - EXPLORING INSIGHTS FROM SYNTHETIC AIRLINE DATA ANALYSIS WITH QLIK

The project "Exploring Insights from Synthetic Airline Data Analysis with Qlik" involves utilizing synthetic airline data to derive valuable insights using Qlik, a business intelligence and data visualization tool. 

In this project, the synthetic airline data simulates various aspects of airline operations, including flight schedules, passenger demographics, ticket sales, and performance metrics. The objective is to leverage Qlik's analytical capabilities to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within this data, aiding in decision-making processes for airlines, airports, and related stakeholders.

Scenario 1: Revenue Optimization
An airline wants to optimize its revenue by analyzing historical ticket sales data, identifying peak travel times, popular destinations, and pricing strategies. Using Qlik, they can visualize revenue trends over time, segment customers based on purchasing behavior, and adjust pricing strategies accordingly to maximize profitability.

Scenario 2: Operational Efficiency
An airport authority aims to enhance operational efficiency by analyzing flight schedules, passenger flows, and luggage handling processes. By integrating Qlik with synthetic airline data, they can identify bottlenecks in airport operations, predict peak traffic periods, and allocate resources effectively to streamline processes and improve overall efficiency.

Scenario 3: Customer Experience Enhancement
Airlines are keen to enhance the passenger experience by understanding customer preferences, satisfaction levels, and pain points. Through sentiment analysis on customer feedback data integrated with Qlik, airlines can identify areas for improvement, personalize services, and tailor marketing campaigns to better meet customer needs, ultimately fostering loyalty and satisfaction.

Data Collection & Extraction From Database
Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information on variables of interest, in an established systematic fashion that enables one to answer stated research questions, test hypotheses, evaluate outcomes and generate insights from the data.
Understand the data.
Data contains all the meta information regarding the columns described in the CSV files
Column Description of the Dataset:
Passenger ID - Unique identifier for each passenger
First Name - First name of the passenger
Last Name - Last name of the passenger
Gender - Gender of the passenger
Age - Age of the passenger
Nationality - Nationality of the passenger
Airport Name - Name of the airport where the passenger boarded
Airport Country Code - Country code of the airport's location
Country Name - Name of the country the airport is located in
Airport Continent - Continent where the airport is situated
Continents - Continents involved in the flight route
Departure Date - Date when the flight departed
Arrival Airport - Destination airport of the flight
Pilot Name - Name of the pilot operating the flight
Flight Status - Current status of the flight (e.g., on-time, delayed, canceled)

Data Preparation
Preparing the data for visualization involves cleaning the data to remove irrelevant or missing data, transforming the data into a format that can be easily visualized, exploring the data to identify patterns and trends, filtering the data to focus on specific subsets of data, preparing the data for visualization software, and ensuring the data is accurate and complete. This process helps to make the data easily understandable and ready for creating visualizations to gain insights into performance and efficiency. Since the data is already cleaned, we can move to visualization.
Data Visualization
Data visualization is the process of creating graphical representations of data to help people understand and explore the information. The goal of data visualization is to make complex data sets more accessible, intuitive, and easier to interpret. By using visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps, data visualizations can help people quickly identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.

Story
A data story is a way of presenting data and analysis in a narrative format, with the goal of making the information more engaging and easier to understand. A data story typically includes a clear introduction that sets the stage and explains the context for the data, a body that presents the data and analysis in a logical and systematic way, and a conclusion that summarizes the key findings and highlights their implications. Data stories can be told using a variety of mediums, such as reports, presentations, interactive visualizations, and videos.

Amount Of Data Loaded
"Amount of Data Loaded" refers to the quantity or volume of data that has been imported, retrieved, or loaded into a system, software application, database, or any other data storage or processing environment. It's a measure of how much data has been successfully processed and made available for analysis, manipulation, or use within the system.

Welcome to our exploration of insights from synthetic airline data analysis with Qlik! In this video, we'll dive into how we used Qlik's powerful data visualization tools to uncover valuable insights and trends in the airline industry.
Using synthetic data that simulates real-world airline operations, we analyzed flight schedules, passenger demographics, ticket sales, and performance metrics. Our goal was to leverage Qlik’s analytical capabilities to reveal patterns and trends, aiding decision-making processes for airlines, airports, and other stakeholders.

we focused on enhancing operational efficiency for airport authorities. By analyzing flight schedules, passenger flows, and luggage handling processes, we pinpointed operational bottlenecks. Qlik’s predictive analytics enabled us to forecast peak traffic periods and optimize resource allocation, streamlining airport operations and boosting overall efficiency.

we aimed to enhance the passenger experience. Sentiment analysis on customer feedback helped us understand preferences, satisfaction levels, and pain points. With these insights, airlines can personalize services and tailor marketing campaigns to better meet customer needs, fostering loyalty and satisfaction.

Here are some key findings from our analysis:

Total number of passengers: 157.7k
Passengers affected by cancelled flights: 52.66k
Passengers affected by flight delays: 52.53k
Flights on time: 52.54k
Top travel months: May, August, July, February, and September
Leading nations by passenger numbers: China, Indonesia, Russia, Philippines, and Brazil

Preparing the data was a crucial step. We ensured the data was clean, accurate, and ready for visualization. This allowed us to create intuitive graphical representations, making complex datasets more accessible and easier to interpret.

In summary, our project showcased how Qlik can transform synthetic airline data into actionable insights. By optimizing revenue strategies, improving operational efficiencies, and enhancing customer experiences, we demonstrated the immense potential of data-driven decision-making in the airline industry.
